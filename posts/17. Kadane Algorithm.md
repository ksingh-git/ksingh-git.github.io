# Kadane Algo
When you get a max subarray, the remaining subarrays are less than it and for one of them is minimum and this is useful when using circular arrays

```python
total = 0
max_total = nums[0]
for i in nums:
    total = max(total + i, i)
    max_total = max(max_total, total)
return max_total
```
OR

```python
total = 0
max_total = nums[0]
for i in nums:
    if total < 0:
        total = 0
    total += i
    max_total = max(max_total, total)
return max_total
```
