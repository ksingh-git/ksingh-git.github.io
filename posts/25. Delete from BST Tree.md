Deleting a node from a Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental operation. Here's a Python implementation to delete a node from a BST while maintaining its properties.

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, root, key):
        def findInorderPreSuccessor(root):
            while root.right:
                root = root.right
            return root

        def deleteBSTNode(root, target):
            if root is None:
                return None
            elif root.val > target:
                root.left = deleteBSTNode(root.left, target)
            elif root.val < target:
                root.right = deleteBSTNode(root.right, target)
            else:
                # Found the node
                if not root.left:
                    return root.right
                elif not root.right:
                    return root.left
                else:
                    # Node has both children
                    temp = findInorderPreSuccessor(root.left)
                    root.val = temp.val
                    root.left = deleteBSTNode(root.left, temp.val)
            return root

        return deleteBSTNode(root, key)
```

## Explanation

### Approach:

1. **Locate the Node to Delete**

   - Traverse the tree using the BST properties to locate the node with the given `key`.

2. **Handle Different Cases**

   - **Node with no children:** Directly remove the node.
   - **Node with one child:** Replace the node with its child.
   - **Node with two children:**
     - Find the inorder predecessor (the largest node in the left subtree).
     - Replace the value of the node to be deleted with the inorder predecessor's value.
     - Recursively delete the inorder predecessor node.

3. **Helper Functions**
   - `findInorderPreSuccessor`: Finds the inorder predecessor for nodes with two children.
   - `deleteBSTNode`: Handles the recursive deletion process.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:**

  - Searching the node to delete: O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
  - Deleting the node: O(h).
  - Overall: O(h).

- **Space Complexity:** O(h) due to recursive calls on the stack.

## Example Usage

To delete a node with value `5` from a BST:

```python
# Example tree node structure
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

root = TreeNode(5, TreeNode(3), TreeNode(7))
s = Solution()
new_root = s.deleteNode(root, 5)
```

This implementation ensures the BST remains valid after the deletion.
