## ðŸ§  What is Unsupervised Learning?

- **Goal**: Discover hidden patterns or structures in data without any labels.
- Unlike supervised learning, there's no clear input-output mapping.
- It's about **exploring and organizing** raw data.

---

## ðŸ§© Key Applications

### 1. **Clustering**

- Group similar data points together.
- Example: Segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Algorithm**: K-means is a commonly used clustering technique.

### 2. **Dimensionality Reduction**

- Simplify data while preserving important features.
- Useful when datasets have many variables.
- **Technique**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## ðŸ§® How Clustering Works

- Clustering algorithms divide data into groups based on similarity.
- **K-means**:

  - You choose how many clusters (k) you want.
  - The algorithm assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center.

## ðŸ”» Dimensionality Reduction in Practice

- Helps in visualizing high-dimensional data.
- **PCA**:

  - Finds directions (components) that capture the most variance.
  - Projects the data into a smaller space using those components.

## âœ… Benefits of Unsupervised Learning

- Great for **data exploration** and **pattern discovery**.
- No need for labeled data, which saves time.
- Helps improve preprocessing for supervised tasks.

Use unsupervised techniques when you're not sure what you're looking for â€” they help uncover hidden stories in the data!
