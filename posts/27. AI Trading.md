**Welcome to your Investment Garden!** 🌱

Just like a thriving garden needs soil, water, and care, a successful trading strategy requires data, analysis, and ongoing attention. In this friendly guide, we’ll show you how to plant seeds (data), nurture them (calculations), and harvest profits (strategy)—no gardening or coding background needed!

## 🌿 Chapter 1: Preparing the Soil — Gathering Data

Before planting, you prepare the soil. In trading:

- **Historical Prices** are your soil nutrients:

  - **Date**: The calendar for each planting day.
  - **Open/High/Low/Close**: Morning moisture, midday heat, cool evening, and where the soil settles.
  - **Volume**: How many seeds (shares) were sown.

**How to collect data**:

- **Yahoo Finance CSV**: Download and open in Excel or Google Sheets.
- **Python shortcut**:

  ```python
  import yfinance as yf
  data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2025-06-01', end='2025-07-01')
  ```

> **Tip**: Ensure no missing days—gaps are like dry patches in your garden! 🌵

## 💧 Chapter 2: Watering Plants — Computing Returns

Water keeps plants growing. Returns measure daily growth:

- **Formula**: (Today’s Price − Yesterday’s Price) ÷ Yesterday’s Price
- **Everyday example**: A plant grows from 10cm to 11cm → (11−10)/10 = **10%** growth.
- **Stock example**: AAPL \$130 → \$132 → ≈ **1.54%** growth.

**In Sheets**:

1. Put yesterday’s price in A2, today’s in B2.
2. C2: `=(B2−A2)/A2` → Format as percentage.

This tells you how much each plant (investment) grew daily. 🌼

## ☀️ Chapter 3: Sunshine Check — Evaluating Performance

Plants need the right amount of sun and shade. In trading, we check:

1. **Cumulative Return** (total harvest): How much \$1 grew overall.
2. **Average Daily Return**: Typical daily growth.
3. **Volatility** (weather swings): How erratic the growth—measured by standard deviation.
4. **Sharpe Ratio**: Growth vs. risk—like fertilizer efficiency.
5. **Max Drawdown**: Worst dry spell—the deepest drop in value.

> **Visualization**: Plot your portfolio’s value in Sheets or Python to watch the garden flourish—or wilt. 📈🌻

## 🌸 Chapter 4: Adding Fertilizer — Creating Indicators

Fertilizer boosts growth. Indicators highlight healthy or stressed plants:

- **Moving Average (MA)**: Smooth nutrient flow—averages last 5 or 20 days.
- **Momentum**: Growth speed—are plants accelerating?
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Stress indicator—overbought (crowded pots) or oversold (empty fields).

**Sheet formula**: MA = `=AVERAGE(B2:B6)`

These signals help you know when to water more or ease off. 💦

## 📝 Chapter 5: Planting Plan — Defining Strategy Rules

A planting plan outlines when and where to sow seeds:

**Example: MA Crossover Strategy**

1. **Short MA** = 5-day average.
2. **Long MA** = 20-day average.
3. **Plant (Buy)** when short MA rises above long MA. 🌱
4. **Harvest (Sell)** when it falls below. 🌾

**Position Size**: If your garden budget is \$1,000 and you risk 5%, each patch uses \$50.

**Test Run**: Apply your plan on past seasons (historical data) to see if you’d harvest well. 🎥

## ✅ Chapter 6: Harvest Review — Backtesting & Analysis

After harvest, you review yields:

- **Win Rate**: How many plots produced fruit? (winning trades/total trades)
- **Profit Factor**: Total yield ÷ total losses—sweetness ratio.
- **Max Drawdown**: Worst drought (biggest drop).
- **Average Hold Time**: How long plants stayed before harvest.

**Exercise**: Log each trade as a harvest record—entry, exit, profit %. Summarize in Sheets.

## 🌻 Chapter 7: Your First Garden Project

1. **Pick a stock** (e.g., TSLA).
2. **Collect** one month of historical prices.
3. **Compute** daily returns.
4. **Calculate** 5-day & 20-day MAs.
5. **Plant/Harvest signals** when they cross.
6. **Review** harvest results: win rate, profit factor, worst drought.

**Happy gardening—and may your investment blooms flourish!** 🌷
