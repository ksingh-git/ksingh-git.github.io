## ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts

- **Data Science in Trading**: Using machine learning to make trading decisions based on data patterns.
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Systematic, math-based approach to decision making in markets.
- **Workflow Overview**:
  1. Collect historical data
  2. Calculate returns
  3. Analyze performance
  4. Add indicators
  5. Build a strategy
  6. Evaluate it

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Data Collection

- Gather stock data using tools like `yfinance`.
- Common data: Open, Close, High, Low, Volume, Adjusted Close.
- Store it in a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

---

## ðŸ”„ Calculating Returns

- **Simple Return**: (Current Price - Previous Price) / Previous Price
- **Log Return**: ln(Current Price / Previous Price)
- Log returns are preferred for their additive property.

---

## ðŸ“Š Performance Evaluation

- **Cumulative Return**: Total return over a period.
- **Annual Return**: Average return projected yearly.
- **Volatility**: How much returns vary.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Return-to-risk ratio (higher is better).
- **Max Drawdown**: Largest drop from peak to trough.

---

## ðŸ§® Indicators

- Help generate signals.
- **Moving Averages** (Simple and Exponential) smooth out noise.
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** measures overbought/oversold conditions.
- **MACD**: Trend-following momentum indicator.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Strategy Development

- Use rules based on indicators (e.g. MA crossover).
- Simulate trades using historical data (backtesting).
- Track entry/exit points, holding time, and returns.

---

## ðŸ“‰ Evaluation Metrics

- **Win Rate**: % of profitable trades.
- **Profit Factor**: Total gains / total losses.
- **Max Drawdown**: Risk exposure.
- **Calmar Ratio**: Annual return / Max drawdown.

---

## ðŸ§ª Backtesting

- Test strategies on past data before using real money.
- Validate using separate data (train/test split).

---

## âœ… Summary

- Use data science to build rule-based strategies.
- Focus on clean data, meaningful indicators, and good performance metrics.
- Always backtest before going live!
