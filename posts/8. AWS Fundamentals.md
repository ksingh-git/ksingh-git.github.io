## Regions

Regions are geographic locations worldwide where AWS hosts its data centers.

### Main aspects when deciding which AWS Region

1. Latency
2. Price
3. Service availability
4. Data compliance

## AZ

Inside every Region is a cluster of Availability Zones (AZ). An AZ consists of one or more data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity

## Interacting with AWS

Every action you make in AWS is an API call that is authenticated and authorized. In AWS, you can make API calls to services and resources through

1. AWS Management Console
2. AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
3. AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)

## AWS Shared Responsibility Model

AWS is responsible for security **OF** the cloud.
Customer is responsible for security **IN** the cloud.
