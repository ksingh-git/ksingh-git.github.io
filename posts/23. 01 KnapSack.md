# 0/1 KnapSack Problem

The 0/1 Knapsack problem aims to maximize the total value of items that can be included in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity. Here's an implementation using dynamic programming in Python:

```python
from pprint import pprint

# Define the maximum capacity of the knapsack
max_capacity = 6

# Define the values and weights of the items
values = [5, 4, 3, 2]
weights = [4, 3, 2, 1]

# Add a dummy item with value and weight zero at the beginning to simplify indexing
values.insert(0, 0)
weights.insert(0, 0)

# Initialize the DP table with zeros
dp = [[0 for _ in range(max_capacity + 1)] for _ in range(len(values))]

# Fill the DP table
for i in range(1, len(values)):
    for j in range(1, max_capacity + 1):
        if weights[i] > j:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], values[i] + dp[i - 1][j - weights[i]])

# Print the DP table
pprint(dp)
```

This code implements the dynamic programming solution to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem, filling out the DP table and printing the result.

## Explanation

### Initialization:

- `max_capacity` is set to 6.
- `values` and `weights` arrays are defined with the values and weights of the items, respectively.
- A dummy item with value and weight zero is added at the beginning of the arrays. This simplifies the indexing in the dynamic programming table.

### Base Case Initialization:

- The DP table `dp` is initialized with zeros.

### Filling the DP Table:

- For each item `i` and each capacity `j`, the code decides whether to include the item `i` in the knapsack or not.
- If the weight of item `i` is greater than the current capacity `j`, it cannot be included, and the value remains the same as without the item (`dp[i-1][j]`).
- If the item can be included, the code calculates the maximum value by considering both possibilities (including the item or not) and takes the maximum of the two.

The final value at `dp[rows-1][cols-1]` represents the maximum value that can be achieved with the given items and the knapsack capacity.
