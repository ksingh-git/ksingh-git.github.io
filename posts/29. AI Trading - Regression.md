## 📘 Supervised Learning Basics

- Uses labeled data (inputs and known outputs).
- Commonly used for classification and regression.
- In trading: used to predict future stock returns from past data.

---

## 📈 Linear Regression

- Models the relationship: `y = β0 + β1 * x`
- β0: baseline value when x = 0
- β1: amount y changes when x increases by 1 unit
- Used to estimate how features affect stock returns.

---

## ⚠️ Overfitting Problem

- Happens when a model learns noise instead of real patterns.
- Leads to poor performance on new data.

---

## ✅ Regularization Techniques

Helps avoid overfitting by penalizing complex models.

### Ridge Regression (L2)

- Adds squared coefficients as penalty.
- Keeps all features, shrinks their values.
- Cost function:

  ```
  Loss = SSE + λ * Σ(β²)
  ```

### Lasso Regression (L1)

- Adds absolute value of coefficients as penalty.
- Can reduce some coefficients to zero (feature selection).
- Cost function:

  ```
  Loss = SSE + λ * Σ|β|
  ```

### Elastic Net Regression

- Combines Ridge and Lasso.
- Useful when features are correlated.
- Cost function:

  ```
  Loss = SSE + λ1 * Σ|β| + λ2 * Σ(β²)
  ```

## 📌 Key Concepts

- Standardizing data is important to avoid bias.
- Feature selection helps reduce noise.
- Predictions can be used to define trading strategies.
- Example: go long when predicted return > 0.

---

## 📊 In Trading Context

- Regression can predict future returns using historical data.
- Helps remove human bias (e.g. emotional trading).
- Important to balance model complexity with predictive power.
- Regularization selects useful features while avoiding overfitting.

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Supervised learning maps inputs to outputs using past data.
- Linear regression is simple but can overfit.
- Ridge keeps all features; Lasso selects only important ones.
- Elastic Net balances both.
- All techniques can support building better trading algorithms.

Use this summary to review regression and regularization when building models.
