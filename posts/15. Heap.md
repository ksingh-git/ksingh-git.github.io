description: "Heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C."

Heaps are special kinds of binary trees where each parent node has a value less than or equal to its children. In this implementation, arrays are used, and for any position 'k' in the array, the value at that position (heap[k]) is less than or equal to the values at its two children positions (heap[2k+1] and heap[2k+2]). It's like organizing numbers in a specific way. The smallest number is always at the top (heap[0])

For programming use these formulas -

1. left child - [2k+1]
2. right child - [2k+2]
3. parent - [n/2 - (n+1)%2]
